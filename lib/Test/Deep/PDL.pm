=head1 NAME

Test::Deep::PDL - Test piddles inside data structures with Test::Deep

=head1 VERSION

version 0.07

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is just an implementation class. Look at the documentation for test_pdl()
in L<Test::PDL>.

=for Pod::Coverage init descend diag_message renderExp renderGot

=head1 BUGS

The implementation of this class depends on undocumented subroutines in
L<Test::Deep>. This may break if L<Test::Deep> gets refactored.
